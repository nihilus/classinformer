"Class Informer"
=========================================================
IDA Pro Win32 class vftable finder, namer, fixer, viewer plug-in.
Version 1.06, January 2013
By Sirmabus

---------------------------------------------------------

Scans an MSVC 32bit target IDB for vftables with C++ RTTI, and MFC RTCI type
data. Places structure defs, names, labels, and comments to make more sense of
class vftables ("Virtual Function Table") and make them read easier as an aid
to reverse engineering.
Creates a list window with found vftables for browsing.

RTTI ("Run-Time Type Identification"):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTTI

RTCI ("Run Time Class Information") the MFC forerunner to "RTTI":
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fych0hw6(VS.80).aspx

It's currently targeted Microsoft Visual C++ 32bit complied binaries.
Will get unpredictable results if used on other targets.

Based off of the article and IDC scripts by Igor Skochinsky:

-- [Install] --------------------------------------------
Copy the plug-in to your IDA Pro "plugins" directory.
Then edit your "..\plugins\plugins.cfg" to setup with a hotkey.

IE: Add these two lines:

; Sirmabus "Class Informer" plug-in
Class-Informer IDA_ClassInformer_PlugIn.plw Alt-7 0

See IDA documentation for more on installing and using plug-ins.


-- [How to run it] --------------------------------------
Invoke as typical in IDA with hot key, or through IDA's Edit->Plugins menu.

By default the assumed code segment is the first ".text" found, and the default
data segments where vftables are to be found are ".rdata" and ".data".
You can select the code and data segments manually using the "Choose xxx-
segments" on the main plug-in dialog.
Multi-select segments using your mouse with the usual SHIFT and CTRL key
Windows UI convention.
In lieu of a missing IDA SDK function I use a hack to get the selection list
that doesn't work for the IDA QT version. Using the QT version select the
segments you want then right click on the list and do the "Select" option, then
"Okay" to finish. If all goes well it in the output window you will see
"Segment(s) selected:" followed by the segment name(s) you selected.

The plug-in will typically take from just a few seconds to several minutes, to
run depending on the size of the target, and generally how fast the host
machine is.

Try using my "Extra Pass" plug-in first for best results, as the ".text"
segment clean up might expose more valid tables.

On completion a list window will come up showing any found vftables and
and relevant class information.
Click on a line to jump right to it.

If you want to save the list to text file, get a debug output viewer like
Mark Russinovich's excellent "DebugView" at:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx

Example list output:
0046769C 077 CEdit:CWnd, CCmdTarget, CObject;  (SI)

This is: vftable address, method count, and class hierarchy ended with some
additional class info.
To make things easier to read, all known type names are considered to be a
"class" unless explicitly proceeded with "struct" to indicate "structure" type.

The addition info at the end:
"(SI)" single inheritance hierarchy, "(MI)" multiple inheritance,
"(VI)" virtual inheritance, or "(MI VI)" multiple virtual inheritance.
If there is an absence of one of these then it's a MFC 'RTCI' type.

Known to work on only IDA 6.x and greater.


-- [Design] -------------------------------------------

I read Igor Skochinsky's excellent article "Reversing Microsoft Visual C++",
then some time later tried his attached IDC scripts accompanying the article.
I was amazed at how well it worked in identifying vftables with type info and
how it cleaned the IDB up (a large MSVC compiled target).

IMHO it can be overlooked if you RE'ing MSVC C++ targets.
I wanted to put it into a plug-in for speed, flexibility, and as a general test
bed for R&D in the area.

I originally wanted to have automatic member naming.
The idea being to take the class name and at least partially naming
member functions (mostly ignoring calling and returning arguments).
But decided it probably isn't that useful.
And there will probably be a lot of redundancy that can ends up in custom sigs,
as noise.
Also the same reasoning I did not use the ctor and dtor identifications
found in Igorsk's scripts.

For my RE work I just want to see these classes by name, and where to find
them for examination.

Essentially, it works a lot like Igorsk's scripts, with some differences like
additionally handling the MFC 'RTCI' types, placing type structures (rather
then the individual fields), and does some static/global ctor/dtor processing.

I got tired of IDA's only partially functioning wait box, so I sub-classed it
to get more control and add some additional UI elements.
Should now have near instant cancel when you click the "Cancel" button or on
pressing the "break" key.
To better show progress I fancied it up a bit with with a little progress bar,
and indicator with text animation.

-- [History] -----------------------------------

1.06 - 1) Added persistent vftable list storage.
       2) Removed the many unnecessary "autoWait()" calls that caused a bit of
          slow down.
       3) Fixed broken and updated some custom UI elements.
       4) Fixed the multi-segment select feature for the non-QT version and
          added a working setup for the QT version too. For QT, after desired
          segments are selected right click on the list and do "Select"
          followed by the "Okay" button.
       5) Added the ".data" segment to the default data search since vftables
          are often located there (in addition to ".rdata").

1.05 - 1) The problem with the plug-in not being ready on invocation was fixed
          by returning PLUGIN_KEEP on init to stay resident.
       2) The fix in 1.04 didn't quite do it for structure placement problems.
          In particular there remains a run on problem in IDA when marking some
          areas "unknown"; these "do_unknown()" calls have been removed and
          each structure element is individually placed one by one before
          attempting to place the actual assorted structures.

1.04 - 1) Now ensures RTTI type name strings are set.

1.03 - 1) Added check and warning message for invalid start and end addresses
          with "_initterm" type static/global ctor & dtor tables.
          Would cause a negative count run-on condition that could trample over
          a large data area.
       2) UI customizations auto-disabled when using IDA Qt version.
       3) Current IDA view is refreshed on completion to show changes.
       4) Fixed a stall that could result from repeated failed attempts at an
          RTTI type placement. Plus fixed the pattern for these so they could
          be properly placed.

1.02 - 1) Added user code and data segment selector.
          Allows user to select multiple data and code segments instead of the
          default of ".text" and ".rdata" by name.
          For those rare executable targets that have multiple code sections,
          and, or, unpacked executables with mixed segments, etc.
       2) Added config option for verbose output to the debugger channel.
       3) Improved overall processing speed.
       4) Since there can multiple instances of the same class or structure,
          and IDA names must be unique all duplicate names are now serialized.
          More things labeled, and no more "duplicate name" warning spam.
          Note: Effects only label names, commented names are not altered
       5) Updated to IDA SDK 5.5
       6) Added links to Sirmabus IDA plug-ins support forum.

1.01 - 1) No longer pops up an error and exits IDA when an incompatible IDB is
          loaded. Just displays a "not loaded" log message now.
       2) Fixed IDA tab page update issue.
       3) Now built with IDA SDK 5.4, and tested with IDA 5.4.
       4) Fixed incorrect string placement in the RTTI type info struct.
          Now the structures are right which make a cleaner DB.
          This was a major bottleneck that caused the structure placement to be
          about 36x slower, now only about 1x.
       5) Fixed some misspellings.

-- [TODO] ---------------------------------------------
Get compiler specific info for at least other popular compilers (Intel,
Borland, GCC, etc), make an IDA 64bit version?
